# ðŸ“‹ Dynamic Form â€“ React + TypeScript App (Frontend-Focused)

**Dynamic Form** is a frontend App project built from scratch.  
The focus is **entirely on the frontend layer**:  
âœ… clean architecture,  
âœ… dynamic UI behavior,  
âœ… responsiveness,  
âœ… and user experience.

The app communicates with a backend API, where the endpoint is defined via environment variables (`.env`).
